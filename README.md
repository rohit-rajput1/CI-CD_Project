# Project Overview

**[Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Project](/CI-CD_Project.md)**

1. **Docker Containerization:**
Containerize your Node.js application by creating a Dockerfile specifying dependencies, environment configurations, and application setup. Build the Docker image locally and push it to a container registry like Docker Hub.

2. **Docker Compose Configuration:**
Create a docker-compose.yml file defining the services needed for your Node.js application, including the database or other dependencies. Use Docker Compose to manage the multi-container application setup.

3. **Jenkins CI/CD Setup:**
Configure a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline by defining a Jenkinsfile that includes stages for code checkout, building the Docker image, testing, and pushing the image to the container registry.

4. **GitHub Webhook Integration:**
Set up a webhook in your GitHub repository to trigger the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline on each push. Configure the webhook to notify Jenkins about code changes, automatically initiating the build and deployment process.
